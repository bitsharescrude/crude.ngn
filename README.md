# bitshares-Naira
This asset aims to bridge the gap between the NAIRA and the bitshares ecosystem

# Introduction
The bitshares ecosystem is still limited to only major currencies like USD, EUR, CNY and BTC, there is currently no direct way to trade the NGN with the bitshares core token except by conversion, a new currency pegged to the value of the NGN will breach this gap and create a new economy on the bitshares DEX wallet.
# Flow Plan
* The account owner vnc7 will create another account called "Xbits.vnc7"
* vnc7 will create CRUDE brand asset token
* vnc7 will then create Asset called CRUDE.NGN
* vnc7 will issue a predetermined (capped at 50,000BTS=>NGN) amount of CRUDE.NGN, to Xbits.vnc7.
* Xbits.vnc7 will then perform the cash transactions for other users including vnc7 (N/B Except for the account owner, all funds issued will get to the Xbits.vnc7 account before they can be spent in order to ensure accountability)
* Xbits.vnc7 will not be involved in market making.
* Xbits.vnc7 will operate with like a teller.
* Users can then trade CRUDE.NGN for other tokens or transfer them to other users who are willing to accept the token for their services.
# Target users
this token is meant for all bitshares users who wish to trade or transact with XBITS.NGN, but especially meant for the Nigerian bitshares community who can also withdraw the token as physical cash.

# Protocol

# Asset class
UIA Utility token
# Market Restrictions
Due to the current whitelisting rules on Bitshares, crude.tokens may only be tradeable with BTS (N/B other tradeable assets may be owned by fraudsters, trade with caution)
# Asset Economy
The owner understands that the value of his asset is dependent on the value he can give (assuming there's no demand the asset value is zero) with this understanding initial users who buy the CRUDE.NGN for trading may face devaluation in order for the owner to create value, BTS markers equal to the total equivalent amount of the asset has to be available for liquidity. The marker starting price, is the price of the real world asset, the token represents, in this case Naira).  If for any reason there's price manipulation aka dump users who panic sell will lose the equivalent value of their token in BTS. This method will encourage holding rather than selling the tokens.
The user must have at least the equivalent amount of Naira supply in his cash wallet should local users decide to cash out. (excess supply will be reflected in the xbits.vnc7 account, the excess supply is the amount the owner doesn't have as raw cash, the lesser the supply the richer the owner).
N/B Token true value is determined by the least BTS buy order that covers total supply, but the token will always be assumed, to be  1:1 for NGN.
N/B the excess supply will never be used for trading only the owner account can trade.
