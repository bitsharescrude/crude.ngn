# bitshares-Naira
This asset aims to bridge the gap between the NAIRA and the bitshares ecosystem

# Introduction
The bitshares ecosystem is still limited to only major currencies like USD, EUR, CNY and BTC, there is currently no direct way to trade the NGN with the bitshares core token except by conversion, a new currency pegged to the value of the NGN will breach this gap and create a new economy on the bitshares DEX wallet.
# Flow Plan
* The account owner vnc7 will create another account called "Xbits.vnc7"
* vnc7 will create CRUDE brand asset token
* vnc7 will then create Asset called CRUDE.NGN
* vnc7 will issue a predetermined (capped at 50,000BTS=>NGN) amount of CRUDE.NGN, to Xbits.vnc7.
* Xbits.vnc7 will then perform the cash transactions for other users including vnc7 (N/B Except for the account owner, all funds issued will get to the Xbits.vnc7 account before they can be spent in order to ensure accountability)
* Xbits.vnc7 will not be involved in market making.
* Xbits.vnc7 will operate with like a teller.
* Users can then trade CRUDE.NGN for other tokens or transfer them to other users who are willing to accept the token for their services.
* Local user's Naira funds will be converted to USD, in the wallet in order to improve dollar liquidity the rate of conversion will be at eNGN rates, local naira users should always check excess supply for accountability.
* Foreigners are welcomed to buy the CRUDE.NGN token, rates will remain at CRUDE.NGN rates for foreigners same applies for BTS and BTC.
* The Assets are considered volatile thus users agree that the value of their naira/assets can change anytime. (N/B CRUDE.NGN will still remain 1:1 for physical naira)
- Pls check records for current rates
# Target users

# CRUDE.NGN
CRUDE.NGN will be a User Issued Asset (U.I.A), [N/B there will also be CRUDE.NGN as smartcoin in the future]

- the xbits.vnc7 is centralised
# U.I.A Parameters

* Disable confidential transactions (flag)
* Issuer must approve all transfer (flag)

# Market Restrictions

# Asset Economy
The owner understands that the value of his asset is dependent on the value he can give (assuming there's no demand the asset value is zero) with this understanding initial users who buy the CRUDE.NGN for trading may face devaluation in order for the owner to create value, BTS markers equal to the total equivalent amount of the asset has to be available for liquidity. The marker starting price, is the price of the real world asset, the token represents, in this case Naira).  If for any reason there's price manipulation aka dump users who panic sell will lose the equivalent value of their token in BTS. This method will encourage holding rather than selling the tokens.
The user must have at least the equivalent amount of Naira supply (-50,000 initial investor capital) in his cash wallet should local users decide to cash out. (excess supply will be reflected in the xbits.vnc7 account, the excess supply is the amount the owner doesn't have as raw cash, the lesser the supply the richer the owner).
N/B Token true value is determined by the least BTS buy order that covers total supply, but the token will always be assumed, to be  1:1 for NGN.
N/B the excess supply will never be used for trading only the owner account can trade.
# Market pegging
The owner knows the price of cryptocurrencies fluctuate regularly, usually market pegging is done by price feeders for smart assets who feed in the price of the asset at regular intervals based on certain conditions, however CRUDE.NGN is not a smart asset, it's UIA, thus the owner will always try to keep the market pegged by himself, he will do this by setting market orders at the 3 day moving average of the asset everyday typically at open hours, this is to ensure users are getting an approximate exact value in their wallets
- Excess Supply for cryptocurrencies
The owner recognizes the need to issue the naira to himself, this is because he is limited but he also doesn't want to commit fraud by issuing above the amount he can redeem, so how can this problem be solved, simple he sells some cryptocurrency or dollar available to him for the naira by sending them to XBITS.vnc7 just like any customer would, this is like an insurance net for his customers or users, the value of the amount sent will be thesame as the 3D MA of the asset's amount in CRUDE.NGN to avoid foul play and it will be capped at 50,000CRUDE.NGN... this means the owner has daily withdrawal limit is 50,000 CRUDE.NGN (all cryptocurrencies trade with owner will follow the 3D MA
of the asset's price)

- traders can still buy more than 50k CRUDE.NGN even up to any amount, and the funds will be stored in the xbits.vnc7 wallet. The funds will never be used to trade, or withdrawn to owner account for any reason whatsoever, it will also never leave the xbits.vnc7 account to any other wallet except the equivalent amount of naira/cryptocurrency or dollar is paid, always check the excess supply https://BTS.ai/xbits.vnc7 to avoid fraud.

- Owner will always strive to maintain the best security practices prescribed by the BTS Blockchain. This include but not limited to; Multisigin, brainkey and .bin file cold storage, physical asset protection by protecting access devices to the best of his ability, etc.

- Users should remember that use of CRUDE.NGN involves risk, there is no perfect system so only invest what you can afford to lose don't gamble.

- if any of these rules are broken it is fraud and the owner is liable, however users should never risk more than what they can afford to lose.
