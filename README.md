# bitshares-Naira
This asset aims to bridge the gap between the NAIRA and the bitshares ecosystem

# Introduction
The bitshares ecosystem is still limited to only major currencies like USD, EUR, CNY and BTC, there is currently no direct way to trade the NGN with the bitshares core token except by conversion, a new currency pegged to the value of the NGN will breach this gap and create a new economy on the bitshares DEX wallet.
# Flow Plan
* The account owner vnc7 will create another account called "Xbits.vnc7"
* vnc7 will create CRUDE brand asset token
* vnc7 will then create Asset called CRUDE.NGN
* vnc7 will issue a predetermined (capped at 50,000BTS=>NGN) amount of CRUDE.NGN, to Xbits.vnc7.
* Xbits.vnc7 will then perform the cash transactions for other users including vnc7 (N/B Except for the account owner, all funds issued will get to the Xbits.vnc7 account before they can be spent in order to ensure accountability)
* Xbits.vnc7 will not be involved in market making.
* Xbits.vnc7 will operate with like a teller.
* Users can then trade CRUDE.NGN for other tokens or transfer them to other users who are willing to accept the token for their services.
