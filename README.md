# bitshares-Naira
This asset aims to bridge the gap between the NAIRA and the bitshares ecosystem

# Introduction
The bitshares ecosystem is still limited to only major currencies like USD, EUR, CNY and BTC, there is currently no direct way to trade the NGN with the bitshares core token except by conversion, a new currency pegged to the value of the NGN will breach this gap and create a new economy on the bitshares DEX wallet.
# Flow Plan
* The account owner vnc7 will create another account called "Xbits"
* vnc7 will create XBITS brand asset token
* vnc7 will then create Asset called XBITS.NGN 
(N/B the account and symbol name is subject to change, if it is already taken)
* vnc7 will issue a predetermined (capped at 50,000BTS=>NGN) amount of XBITS.NGN, to Xbits.
* Xbits will then perform the cash transactions for other users including vnc7 (N/B all funds issued must get to the Xbits account before they can be spent in order to ensure accountability)
* Xbits will not be involved in market making.
* Xbits will operate with like a teller.
* Users can then trade XBITS.NGN for other tokens or transfer them to other users who are willing to accept the token for their services.
# Target users
this token is meant for all bitshares users who wish to trade or transact with XBITS.NGN, but especially meant for the Nigerian bitshares community who can also withdraw the token as physical cash.
